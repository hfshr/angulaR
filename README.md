# Shiny + angular

Exploring the possibility of using shiny and angular together. Bit hacky and probably a bad idea.

## Build

Running `golem::run_dev()` first builds the angular app and puts the files into inst/app, then runs the golem app as normal.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.
